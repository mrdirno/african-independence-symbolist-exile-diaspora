  "cover_prompt": "A young man in a modern apartment, his back to us, intently studies a worn, leather-bound journal filled with handwritten verse and cryptic diagrams, while outside the rain-streaked window, the ghostly, symbolic silhouette of a Sankofa bird—reaching back—is superimposed over a blurred, oppressive cityscape of a near-future African metropolis. The scene is imbued with a sense of urgent, quiet deciphering, surrounded by relics of exile: a single suitcase, a faded photograph of a proud man in revolutionary attire, and a key resting on the journal's open page. In the richly textured, allegorical, and emotionally resonant style of Wangechi Mutu and the symbolic narrative depth of Lina Iris Viktor, with elements of Lynette Yiadom-Boakye's contemplative intimacy. Book cover framing, centered composition with the subject slightly off-center, viewed from a close, intimate over-the-shoulder angle that draws the eye into the journal's mysteries. Dramatic chiaroscuro lighting with a single desk lamp casting warm, golden pools of light on the journal and key, contrasting with the cool, melancholic blues and greys of the rainy night outside, punctuated by the deep burnt orange and gold of the Sankofa bird. masterpiece, best quality, ultra detailed, intricate details, professional composition, sharp focus, 8k resolution, flux dev."
